# ShiHelper
A web app that I wrote for the final project for my Chinese Poetry class.

It took regulated verse poetry as input, and output an annotated version complete with tone markings and deviations from the suspected tone pattern. 

I wrote it using React, and hosted it on AWS Amplify. 

It has since been taken down because I was worried I am going to forget when my Amplify Free Tier subscription runs out.
