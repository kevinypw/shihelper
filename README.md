# ShiHelper
A web app written for the final project for CHIN-386 â€” Art of Chinese Poetry for the Spring 2021 semester. 

As the restrictions for the final project were very loose, I was able to ideate and create whatever I desired. 

### Capabilities
It takes regulated verse poetry as input, and outputs an annotated version complete with tone markings and deviations from the suspected tone pattern. 

### Specifications
This project was written in React, and was hosted on AWS Amplify. 

As a precaution against forgetting when my AWS Free Tier expires, this project has since been taken down from AWS Amplify. However, you can still run it locally in a development environment. 

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine and run `npm install` in the repository directory to install dependencies. 

To view the app, run `npm start` in the repository directory. The site should be live at `http://localhost:3000/`.
