# ShiHelper
A web app written for the final project for CHIN-386 â€” Art of Chinese Poetry for the Spring 2021 semester. 

As the restrictions for the final project were very loose, I was able to ideate and create whatever I desired with very little input from my professor.

Information about usage is bundled with the React app as a webpage on a navigable route. (/about/)

### Capabilities
It takes regulated verse poetry as input, and outputs an annotated version complete with tone markings and deviations from the suspected tone pattern. 

### Specifications
This project was written in React, and was hosted on AWS Amplify. 

As a precaution against forgetting when my AWS Free Tier expires, this project has since been taken down from AWS Amplify. However, you can still run it locally in a development environment. 

### References
This reference section is also bundled with the React app as a webpage on a navigable route (/sources/). Translation was done using a variety of datasets, including the [Baxter-Sagart Old/Middle Chinese Reconstruction](http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/BaxterSagartOCbyMandarinMC2014-09-20.pdf) and the [MDBG Mandarin Dictionary](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict).
