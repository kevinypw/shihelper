# ShiHelper
A web app written for the final project for CHIN-386 â€” Art of Chinese Poetry for the Spring 2021 semester. 

### Capabilities
It takes regulated verse poetry as input, and outputs an annotated version complete with tone markings and deviations from the suspected tone pattern. 

### Specifications
This project was written in React, and was Hosted on AWS Amplify. 

As a precaution against forgetting when my AWS Free Tier expires, this project has since been taken down from AWS Amplify.
